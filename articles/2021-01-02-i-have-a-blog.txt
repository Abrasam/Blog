title: I Have a Blog
date: 02/01/2021

I've set up this blog for me to document my hobby programming (mostly game development/simulation stuff). I doubt anyone will read it but it's mostly to keep a record for myself (and to flex on friends!).

The blog is stored in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Abrasam/Blog) so feel free to make suggestions or corrections there.

I've set up this blog for me to document my hobby programming (mostly game development/simulation stuff). I doubt anyone will read it but it's mostly to keep a record for myself (and to flex on friends!)

It's built with [toto](https://www.github.com/cloudhead/toto), a very minimailt blogging engine.
